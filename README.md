APPLICATION INTENT :  
Using Semantic UI this is the beginnings of a set of generic components
There are some notable flaws at present:  
* the two-button component doesn't take functions  
* the login component doesn't have any wired functionality, really
* the chat-box is a bit bulbous and stays will grow to fill a page  
The natural extension from this point is to add some kind of users service to handle users throughout the app which will make it easier to extend the functionality of the login page to include errors.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
